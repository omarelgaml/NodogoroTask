# NodogoroTask

Website description:

-For the task I have created a website called quarantine buddy using MERN stack technology. Basically the website is 
a place where an elderly person can post a request asking for help mentioning his/here location, the same thing goes
for an employee who has lost his/her job and needs a help. A volunteer can also post an offer request (that he/she has
extra products for example). All the requests are shared between all the members and divided on 3 tabes (elderly help,
employees help and offering help). The user can mention if he/she wants to mention his/her name of not. The user who wants
to respond to a request will be asked to write his/here response and will be sent be the webite to the request writer 
via email.

-There is private tab called wishlist where the user can write the things that he/she wants to make after the quarantine.

-There are the types of users in the website:
1- an elderly user who can only ask for help in the elderly tab.
2- an employee user who can only ask for help in the employees tab.
3- a volunteer user who can only offer requests in the offering tab.
